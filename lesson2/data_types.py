"""This lesson will talk about the different basic data types that
exist in python.  We'll start with a few that you are probably mostly
familiar with and then we'll move on to ones that are a little bit
more esoteric, but very useful.

Before we start, we should explain what a "type" is.  A "type" tells
you what kind of data you have.  For example whole numbers like 0, 1,
-2, 3456, etc have the type "integer."  Numbers that have a decimal
point like 2.5, 3.1415925635, and even 1.0 have a different type
called "float."  Now, the name "float" doesn't make a ton of sense
right now.  Just trust me, there is a good reason they're called that.
(It has to do with how the computer manipulates them.)

Integers and floats are the basic numeric types.  They're about as
simple as things can get.  You can add, subtract, multiply, and divide
them.  Weird things will happen if you try to divide by 0, just like
in real math.  Try not to do that.  More on this later.

In your python interpreter try playing around with integers.  You
access the interpreter by just typing "python" in your terminal

"""
### Exercise: Type these in the interpreter.  Does anything weird happen?

# 1 + 1
# 4 * 100
# 10 / 5
# 10 / 3
